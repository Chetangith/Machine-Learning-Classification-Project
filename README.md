Chronic Kidney Disease Classification Project==>  To predict the person is having chronic kidney disease or not. We bulid different models for this problem, but our classification use case have very small dataset and most of the model like tree based &amp; boosting models tends to overfit, so for this  we use simple "Logistic Regression" model !!
